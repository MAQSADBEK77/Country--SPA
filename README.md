# Comfy Store implemented with React redux

## I have done this project very well. In this project I used skills like React, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, Redux toolkit



🧑‍💻About how to use the project:

1. Clone the project to your computer.

2. Open the project folder in any terminal.

3. Type npm install in the terminal and wait for a while.

4. After the packages are installed, type npm run dev in the terminal and wait for a while.

5. The terminal will give you a special url address, open it in the browser. ok :)
